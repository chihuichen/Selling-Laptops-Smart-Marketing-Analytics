# Selling-Laptops-Smart-Marketing-Analytics
Assume I am the owner of a retail website. I'm planning on running a promotion on a laptop and want to send emails out about it. However, I only want to send it to people that may be interested in it so as not to annoy people that aren't interested. I'm looking to use data about who clicked on similar emails in 2020 to help predict which users may be interested in the promotion.
